This repository is if you want to submit changes. I'll probably say yes.

The timbre is a sine wave rather than the cool detuned piano, since I wrote the piano in C++. But that requires an extra compile step with emscripten, and then you also need to have a local webserver and set up CORS headers. All that stuff you probably don't want to bother with. The sine wave is good enough.
