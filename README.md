This repository is if you want to submit patches, issues, or questions.

The file is `keyboard.html`. The timbre is a sine wave, because of CORS issues.

If you want the cool piano timbre, then download the repository, run `corsplease.py` to set up a local webserver, then go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/keyboard.html` in your web browser.
